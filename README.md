# RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2

The RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2 repository provides a framework to build a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using quantized versions of the Llama2 language model. This project aims to combine the power of Llama2 with efficient retrieval techniques to answer user queries effectively.

## Introduction
The RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2 project aims to create a high-performance retrieval-augmented generation system leveraging the quantized versions of the Llama2 language model. This system is designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information and generate accurate responses to user queries.

## Prerequisites
Before you start using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (can be installed using pip):
  - langchain
  - chainlit
  - sentence-transformers
  - faiss
  - PyPDF2 (for PDF document loading)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Surya-KF/RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2.git
    cd RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2
    ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the required language models and data. Refer to the Langchain documentation for specific instructions on how to download and set up the language model and vector store.

5. Set up the necessary paths and configurations in your project, including the `DB_FAISS_PATH` variable and other configurations as per your needs.

## Getting Started
To get started with the RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2, follow these steps:
1. Set up your environment and install the required packages as described in the Installation section.
2. Configure your project by updating the `DB_FAISS_PATH` variable and any other custom configurations in the code.
3. Prepare the language model and data as per the Langchain documentation.
4. Start the system by running the provided Python script or integrating it into your application.

## Usage
The RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2 system can be used for answering various queries. To use the system, follow these steps:
1. Start the system by running your application or using the provided Python script.
2. Send a query to the system.
3. The system will retrieve relevant information and generate a response based on the information available in its database.
4. If sources are found, they will be provided alongside the answer.

## Contributing
Contributions to the RAG-using-Quantized-LLAMA2 project are welcome! To contribute, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and ensure that the code passes all tests.
4. Create a pull request to the main repository, explaining your changes and improvements.
